/** \file libtcod_c.c
 *
 *  To statically link a C program with libtcod:
 *
 *  * Add `libtcod_c.c` to your list of source files to compile.
 *  * Add libtcod's include directory.
 *  * Add `SDL2` to be dynamically linked, and add its include directory.
 *    You can get the development libraries from:
 *    https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
 *  * Add `GL` to be dynamically linked.
 *  * Compile and link libtcod's src/vendor/lodepng.cpp file.
 *  * Compile and link `src/vendor/utf8proc/utf8proc.c`.
 *  * Link with `zlib`, and add its include directory.  You can include
 *    libtcod's src/vendor/zlib directory and compile all `.c` files in there
 *    to statically link it.
 *  * If you're using C++ then add `libtcod.cpp` to your source files.
 *
 *  You can define `NO_OPENGL` to remove the dependency on the GL library.
 *  You can also define `TCOD_BARE` to remove the dependency on SDL2 and GL.
